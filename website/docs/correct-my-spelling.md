# Correct my spelling

The user tries to add "biuy breod" to the to do list
but the application tries to correct the spelling.

The website uses TextBlob (https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
to detect misspellings and replies to the API with a suggestion
instead of adding it to the to do list.
