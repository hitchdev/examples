# HitchStory Examples

[![Example stories and docs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hitchdev/examples/main/.github/hitchstory-screenshots-small.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hitchdev/examples/main/.github/hitchstory-screenshots.png)

The following are four rudimentary to do apps each tested with
[HitchStory](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory), a
[StrictYAML based](https://hitchdev.com/hitchstory/why/strictyaml)
FOSS python integration testing framework that autogenerates documentation.

All of the above tests are also running on Github Actions with [no tweaks](https://github.com/hitchdev/examples/blob/main/.github/workflows/regression.yml):

If you'd like help with introducing capabilities like these to your project, [contact me now](hitchdev.com/consulting) for a free consultation.

## Getting started

**Podman must be installed on your system first.**

All other functionality is automated and can be run via one of the 
four key.sh scripts. 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hitchdev/examples.git
$ cd examples/commandlib -OR- restapi -OR- website -OR- pythonapi
$ ./key.sh make
```

## Run all tests

Try this first to see that everything runs:

```
$ ./key.sh regression
```

## Run singular test

This command can be used to acceptance test driven development.

```
$ ./key.sh atdd correct
```

"correct" is a unique keyword used in the name of one of the stories.

## Run singular test in rewrite mode

You can try changing the code to output something different and run this to 
see the story rewrite itself:

```
$ ./key.sh ratdd correct
```

(Note: you will have to run `./key.sh build` first)

## Generate documentation from stories

Running this command in any of the above project folders will regenerate the docs for that project from the stories.

```
$ ./key.sh docgen
```

For the website project, the screenshots and video artefacts
used by the docs are retaken by running:

```
$ ./key.sh recordings
```


## Clean everything

This will delete everything created to run these tests (container/volume):

```
$ ./key.sh clean all
```

Note that it must be run in each project folder you ran make in.

# About the projects

The four folders contain four versions of the same project -
[this great little to do app](https://github.com/ovinokurov/ToDo)
built by [Oleg Vinokurov](https://github.com/ovinokurov) which was built
with a command line, REST and web interface.

The ./key.sh scripts runs the app in a container *inside* the hitch container.

This is done to segregate the test code from the application code.

The website also runs a separate playwright container inside the hitch container.

The hitch container is run with a "gen" volume. This is a podman volume that
contains all builds necessary to run the app.


# Future work on examples

- [X] Generate website images and videos with playwright for use in documentation.
- [ ] Mount code folder with podman so changes reflect instantaneously.
- [ ] Use postgres with to do apps, and demonstrate given preconditions to fill database.
- [ ] Mock the passage of time - to do app with reminder.
- [ ] Show off inheritance (e.g. with a logging in story for website).
